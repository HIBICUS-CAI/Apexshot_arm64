//! Shared helpers for the unit tests that need a live GTK.
//!
//! GTK may be initialized only once per process, on exactly one thread:
//! gtk4-rs panics with "Attempted to initialize GTK from two different
//! threads." when a second thread calls `gtk4::init()`, and GTK objects may
//! only be touched from the thread that won. The test harness gives every test
//! its own thread, so tests that each called `gtk4::init()` fought over that
//! single slot and failed depending on scheduling order (CI: 1086 passed,
//! 1 failed in `gtk_fast_path_is_never_taken_off_the_main_thread`).
//!
//! [`with_gtk`] owns the one permitted GTK thread for the whole test binary.
//! Route every GTK call through it and initialization stays deterministic no
//! matter how the harness orders or parallelizes tests.
